            Front-end web development refers to the process of creating and implementing the user interface and user experience of a website or web application
        </p>
        <p>
            It involves the use of programming languages such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to build and enhance the visual and interactive elements of a website.
        </p>
        <p>
            In front-end development, developers work on translating design concepts into actual web pages by structuring the content, applying styles and layouts, and implementing interactive features. They ensure that the website is visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly across different devices and browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Front-end developers collaborate closely with designers to ensure that the website accurately represents the intended visual and interactive design. They also work alongside back-end developers who handle server-side programming and database interactions to create a seamless and functional web experience
        </p>
        <p> 
            Overall, front-end web development focuses on the client-side of web development, emphasizing the presentation and interaction layers of a website or web application to deliver an engaging and intuitive user experience.

    <div class="HTML">
        <h1>Hypertext Markup Language</h1>
        <h3>POPULARLY KNOWN AS HTML [PRESENT DATED VERSION IS HTML-5]</h3>
        <div style="display: flex;">
            <p style="margin-top: 100px;">To let you understand what actually a HTML is, lets take a human body</p>
            <img src="images/d1/html.avif" alt="human with and without skelton">
        </div>
        <br>
        <center><p>assume that body is like web page and head, hands and legs are components of the webpage<br>
        see what happens to human body if skeleton is absent, no more structure or poster to it</p></center><br><br>
        <span>HTML serves as the skeleton of a web page, providing the structure and content that is displayed in a web browser. Its primary purpose is to define the various elements and their relationships within a web document, allowing browsers to interpret and present the information to users.</span>

        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
        <h3>what is the real purpose of CSS, lets take a example</h3>
        <br><br><div style="display: flex;">
            <img src="images/d1/css1.avif">
            <img src="images/d1/css2.avif">

        <p>I think most of the people stooped looking at that 2nd pic {ofc me too can't stop myself looking at it for a while}</p>
        <br><p>its all because of its stylished look !!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1st image is only HTML</li>
            <li>2nd image is also a HTML page with added CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>when it comes to the engine, interior feathers, efficency ect everything is same but still we need the second one cuz it looks different and stylished</p>

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <h3>Here it goes very intresting because -</h3><br>
        <p>JavaScript has gained significant popularity among developers, who now integrate it into various parts of their technology stack, including back-end systems, front-end web development, hybrid applications, embedded systems, and more, making it essential to understand JavaScript and its workings.</p><br><br>
        <h3>i think u didnt get an clarity to my words so lets take a cool example again</h3>
        <div style="display: flex;">
            <p style="margin-top: 120px;">think about your self [your reaactions and emotions]<br><span style="color: wheat;">your every reaction depends on the actions of your opposite person</span></p>
            <img src="images/d1/js.avif">
        </div><br>
        <p>just imagine ur brain like a javascript and your self as a web application, ur brain adds the actions, emotions, interactivity and functionalty to your body.</p>
        <br><p style="color: wheat;">Exactly here JavaScript in front-end development is to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. It allows developers to create engaging user experiences by manipulating HTML elements, responding to user actions, and communicating with servers.</p>
